# Face blurring software v0.1

## What has this project to offer

This is an attempt to create a functional library of tools for blurring faces in videos.

So far, mainly manual bounding box annotation is supported via opencv.

## What's to come in a (hopefully) near future

I am hoping to populate this respository with a fully automatic face blurring module as well as a semi-automatic

## How to use

At the moment the only module working is *manual_face_blurring.py* which uses opencv
for bounding box definition and KFC opencv tracker for bounding box propagation.
